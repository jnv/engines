Upgrading from Engines 1.1.x to Engines 1.2
===========================================

* change the engine_schema table to plugin_schema
* rename RAILS_ROOT/public/engine_files to RAILS_ROOT/public/plugin_assets
* engine_image, engine_stylesheet and engine_javascript are gone, replaced with image_tag "blah", :plugin => "name" and so on.
