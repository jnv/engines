Upgrading from Engines 1.1.x to Engines 1.2
===========================================

Changes
-------

* change the engine_schema table to plugin_schema
* rename RAILS_ROOT/public/engine_files to RAILS_ROOT/public/plugin_assets
* engine_image, engine_stylesheet and engine_javascript are gone, replaced with image_tag "blah", :plugin => "name" and so on.




Dropped Features
----------------

fixture method
'smart' engine versions - we no longer do fancy stuff with modules, etc
the magic 'config' module, in preference of mattr_accessor :attribute




Todo
----


when testing multiple plugins, it's possible that view mixing/code mixing will cause
functionality to bleed between plugins
- possible add a new test:plugins which tests each one, having only it load?
