Description:
  The plugin migration generator assists in working with schema additions 
  required by plugins. Instead of running migrations from plugins directly,
  the generator creates a regular Rails migration which will be responsible
  for migrating the plugins from their current version to the latest version
  installed.
  
  This is important because the set of application migrations remains an
  accurate record of the state of the database, even as plugins are installed
  and removed during the development process

Example:
  ./script/generate plugin_migration [PLUGINS=<plugin_name>,<plugin_name>]

  This will generate:

    RAILS_ROOT
      |- db
          |-migrate
              |- xxx_plugin_migrations.rb

  which contains the migrations for the given plugin(s)
